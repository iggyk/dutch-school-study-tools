# Dutch school study tools

A random assortment of very crudely written generators of math, spelling and time-telling exercises for kids in Dutch schools (groups 3 to 5 so far).

* Multiplication table
* Summation and subtraction
* Telling the time on analog clock
* Bi-lingual spelling sheets (Dutch-Russian at the moment)
